<h2>📥Download Torrents</h2>
<h4><b>The ability to download Torrents using telegram bot is too common this days!🥱 But I think why not do anything different that will amaze everyone.😲 This Bot comes with the ability to download Torrents either through Torrent File or Magnet Link, with Multi-Engine support like Aric and qBitorrent and User have the ability to choose anyone of the best Engine to download torrent more speedily and easily.🔥But it is not enough to make users experience comfortable, So I have added option through which Users can select files which needs to be downloaded from a Torrent and hence dividing the load! But wait... large number of users like to watch Movies and they need to download movies from there torrent but it is not required anymore, You can watch Movies or Files from a torrent without downloading it to your Device.👁️‍🗨️</b></h4>
<h2>📚Clone File/Folder(s)</h2>
<h4><b>Now all of us know! That making copy of files from one location to another location in Google Drive is to defficult task to perform manually.😣Yeah! I have got you covered!😋 This bot can even clone File/Folders or My Drive or Shared Drive at once! If deployed on Heroku's Ecosystem then bot can provide even 2GB/s and can max clone 2TB at once.For cloning anything bot does't requires much thing! Just the link of File/Folder and that sit.🔗</b></h4>
<h2>🕹️Set Config Vars</h2>
<h4><b>In deployment of every Bot🤖, Owner of the Bot needs to provide or review additional information to Bot so that it can work perfectly and perform heavy tasks but sometimes we (including me also!😀) do some mistakes is it, and hence required to change it by going again and again to site from where we have deployed it. But now its no more.😊 Owners can set/edit/remove the already set config vars value using Bot itself and bot will automatically restart itself to immediately take those changes in effect!</b></h4>
<h2>♻️Automated Update</h2>
<h4><b>When you commit changes in your repository of Bot, then you have to deploy your bot again and again to see the changes you have made in your UPSTREAM REPOSITORY, But not anymore! This bot have the ability to update itself from the repository it is deployed. For best performance always set Official Repository to update with and master branch from which the changes need to be fetched!</b></h4>
<h2>🔗Links</h2>
<h4><b>This Bot is just a master in managing link too!😘After processing any file this Bot provides the User with Links to access there files, but it can also make them short and easy to remember with using large number of services of which the owner provide it API and URL. This bot can even download and upload Mega Links or UptoBox Link and can upload them to Google Drive.This Bot can mirror all Direct Download Link it does not matter which service! just provide direct download link.Users can use even GDTOT links for cloning there files or folders through this bot even more faster!🙂</b></h4>
<h2>📛 Ban Proof</h2>
<h4><b>Now I don't need to explain this much!🤣 The name is self-explaning, If you already deployed your Bots before this on Heroku then you can understand that, sometimes they ban your Account or Suspend deployed bot or app. But you don't have to face that problem anymore! This bot is developed with heavy functions and scripts which can prevent this bot even from critical detection! While handling heavy loads, this bot can restart itself to prevent blockage of your Heroku Account. If still heavy load is not given then bot will restart itself automatically after 24 Hours.This is also a part of Performance optimization, which you will read in next section.</b></h4>
<h2>⚡Optimizations</h2>
<h4><b>When we talk about optimizations! Then almost all things requires it! including bots. This bot also comes with features like auto omptimization and clear cache. There all lots of Commands are already provided in this bot which can be runned by Owners only! Even to boost the performance of this bot, I have added some conditions like if the disk space is get full then bot will automatically cancel the progress before processing it so that only those works can be done which is possible at that time. Bot automatically calculates that how much storage space is required for whole task and deductes it from the Total space so that if the task requires more space than the available once then bot will automatically cancel it without causing any error in others.</b></h4>
<h2>🔎 Torrent Search</h2>
<h4><b>The ability for searching torrent is must for every Torrent leeching bot! and Don't worry, This bot have it. Users can search torrents within bot using Sukebei and nyaasi. I am going to add more Torrent Search options like Pirate bay in the future. For Searching Torrent users can use either "/sukebei Your Query" or "/nyaasi Your Query" to search any Magnet link or Torrent File and can directly use it through the given commands.But wait! This feature is not limited to it, Bot can show total size of torrent and average seeders and leechers that torrent file can provide.And it arrange the fastest Torrent to the top of the list and slowest torrent to the end of the list.</b></h4>
<h2>🎬 YouTube Videos Download</h2>
<h4><b>Downloading Videos from the most popular Video Streaming platform YouTube is just an amazing idea! Dr.Torrent Bot can also download video or even complete YouTube Playlist with custom quality and custom name. Users can also create the zip or tar of Videos downloaded from YouTube directly to Google Drive. The command for downloading it is just simple, "/watch YouTube Video or Playlist Link Quality | Custom Name" , However entering Quality and Custom name is totally optional but if you want to give custom name then you first need to write "|" before it. If you do not enter the quality then Bot will automatically download it in maximum quality the video available in.</b></h4>
<h2>🔒 Authorization and Promotion</h2>
<h4><b>By using this Bot, Owner have the ability to promote or demote a user to Sudo or even Authorize or Unauthorize it so that it can use the bot. This feature is developed in keeping it in mind that it can also be used in large groups. Owner can also authorize a particular chat in which the bot should be used by just using "/auth Group ID" or if the owner authorize a particular user then it can also use the bot in personal chat. Adding Users as sudo provide them the ability to restart and update the bot but however only Owner can see the config vars. Or to authorize or promote a user then take the message of that user or its ID and send "/auth User ID" or "/auth taking the msg as reply" or "/addsudo USER ID" or "/addsudo taking the msg as reply".</b></h4>
<h2>🔩 Packing and File Extraction</h2>
<h4><b>Dr.Torrent Bot have the powerful ability to pack files from Google Drive, Direct Link and Telegram and upload it to Google Drive into .zip or .tar format. The Bot can almost extract any file format easily and fastly without any data corruption.Now for your general information! The compression ratio of .zip format is too low while the compression ratio of .tar file is high! In a recent test which was conducted by me shows that converting a .mp4 file of approx size 2GB into .zip can get its size deducated by only 20 or 30 Kbs while if converted into .tar then there is huge size difference in the actual size and in final output size which was 1.34GB (.Approx) and here is the list of formats which can be easily extracted by the bot:<br>
ZIP, RAR, TAR, 7z, ISO, WIM, CAB, GZIP, BZIP2,<br>
APM, ARJ, CHM, CPIO, CramFS, DEB, DMG, FAT,<br>
HFS, LZH, LZMA, LZMA2, MBR, MSI, MSLZ, NSIS,<br>
NTFS, RPM, SquashFS, UDF, VHD, XAR, Z.</b></h4>
<h2>🛠️ Customizations</h2>
<h4><b>Large Numbers of customizations are provided in the Bot or during the Deployment of the Bot. Onwers can customize each functions as per there needs, they can also create limitations for each functions if the Bot's going to be deployed for large groups. Owners can use there Google Drive Inde with this Bot! The bot will automatically provide the user Index link of file after uploading it. There is no need to do it manually.Bot can automatically detects the Error and tell the Error code and text for a particular situations there are already 50+ Error detectors are added to the bot to help Owner and User to get what the problem is and how to fix it.</b></h4>
